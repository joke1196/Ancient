We fought against each other with no mercy while several races and other living species started a rebellion. At this moment, the Krodux joined the war and won. Indeed, they had found a way to turn the Ancestors into a living massive weapon, \"the Xens\" and used it to exterminate each and every last of them. They made a coup d'Ã©tat and established their power throughout the Galaxy by creating a oligarchical dictatorship : the Galactic Government.
