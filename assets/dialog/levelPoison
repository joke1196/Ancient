"After the battle, the Rebel commandant approached the Heroes. The dialogue began while The Ancestor was getting the power from the Ancient Fluid and the Rebel Army was fighting the Galactic reinforcement.<br/><class='boldCef'>Commandant Cef:</class><class='Cef'> Hei everybody. I hope everybody is Okay? My name is Cef and I'm the leader of the Rebels. Don't worry, the Galactic Government hasn't sent enough reinforcement to win this battle, you're safe with us. I'm here to convince you to work with us on a special plan...</class><br/><class='blue'>-As you can see, the Rebels has the same uniform as mine. I'm sorry to inform you guys that I was a spy during the whole time.</class><br/><class='red'>-What the hell is going on?</class><br/><class='blue'>-Don't worry. The Rebels is here to help you. In fact, we can work together for a same goal: the end of the Galactic Government. The plan is attacking and destroy the Capitole. However, this one is protected by a electromagnetic shield. Therefore, we need to teleport a commando there who will destroy the shield generator.</class><br/><class='boldTheLastAncestor'>The Last Ancestor:</class><class='TheLastAncestor'> You need me. You need my Ancient Power.</class><br/><class='red'>-My goal at the beginning was to take some information to get the Perfect Xen. But nothing went as planned... But why haven't captured us? You could get some informations about the Perfect Xen.</class><br/><class='boldCef'>Commandant Cef:</class> <class='Cef'>I have the Last Ancestor in front of me, right now. You can easily understand that the Perfect Xen has just become the last of my interests. With the Ancestor in our side, we can crush them before they get the Perfect Xen. And I prefer to think that you have a role to play in this civil war, I need you because only the scientist knows the location of the shield generator, and you're foghting pretty well... Ancestor, the whole Rebel's philosophy is based on your people's.. Do you..</class><br/><class='boldTheLastAncestor'>The Last Ancestor:</class> <class='TheLastAncestor'>Of course I accept. I can feel your honesty, your respect for life and your desire for liberty... Let's do this.</class><br/><class='boldCef'>Commandant Cef:</class> <class='Cef'>I sent some Rebels to Corneria before the Galactic Army arrived there.. Your families are safe in the secret Rebel's base. You will be able to join them sooner than you thought...</class><br/><class='red'>-How do you know all those details? And why should we trust you?</class><br/><class='blue'>-You have to keep in mind that we can't live in this kind of dystopia anymore. By helping us, you'll garantee safety for you and your family. Running to an another galaxy is not the solution. The Rebels have worked for centuries to get the strength and the organisation they have now. We just need a little help that will change the Galaxy forever.</class><br/><class='red'>-We're in. You will have your revolution. Let's do this.</class><br/><br/>The alliance between the Heroes and the Rebels are settled, and the Revolution is coming. <br/>"
