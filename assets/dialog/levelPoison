"After the battle, the Rebel commandant approaches the heroes. The dialogue begins while The Ancestor is receiving power from the Ancient Fluid and the Rebel Army is fighting the Galactic reinforcement.<br/><class='boldCef'>Commandant Cef:</class><class='Cef'> Hey everybody. I hope everybody is okay? My name is Cef and I'm the leader of the Rebels. Don't worry, the Galactic Government hasn't sent enough reinforcement to win this battle, you're safe with us. I'm here to convince you to work with us on a special plan...</class><br/><class='blue'>-As you can see, the Rebels have the same uniform as I have. I'm sorry to inform you guys that I was a spy during the whole time.</class><br/><class='red'>-What the hell is going on?</class><br/><class='blue'>-Don't worry. The Rebels are here to help you. In fact, we can work together for the same goal: the end of the Galactic Government. The plan is attacking and destroying the Capitole. However, this one is protected by an electromagnetic shield. Therefore, we need to teleport a commando there who will destroy the shield generator.</class><br/><class='boldTheLastAncestor'>The Last Ancestor:</class><class='TheLastAncestor'> You need me. You need my Ancient Power.</class><br/><class='red'>-My goal at the beginning was to take some information to get the Perfect Xen. But nothing went as planned... But why haven't you captured us? You could have gotten hold of some informations about the Perfect Xen.</class><br/><class='boldCef'>Commandant Cef:</class> <class='Cef'>I have the Last Ancestor in front of me, right now. You can easily understand that the Perfect Xen has just become the last of my interests. With the Ancestor on our side, we can crush them before they get the Perfect Xen. And I prefer to think that you have a role to play in this civil war, I need you because only the scientist know the location of the shield generator. And you can fight pretty well... Ancestor, the whole Rebel's philosophy is based on your people's... Do you...</class><br/><class='boldTheLastAncestor'>The Last Ancestor:</class> <class='TheLastAncestor'>Of course I accept. I can feel your honesty, your respect for life and your desire for liberty... Let's do this.</class><br/><class='boldCef'>Commandant Cef:</class> <class='Cef'>I had sent some Rebels to Corneria before the Galactic Army arrived there... Your families are safe in the secret Rebel's base. You will be able to join them sooner than you thought...</class><br/><class='red'>-How do you know all these details? And why should we trust you?</class><br/><class='blue'>-You have to keep in mind that we can't live in this kind of dystopia anymore. By helping us, you'll guarantee safety for you and your family. Running to an another galaxy is not a solution. The Rebels have worked for centuries to get the strength and the organisation they have now. We just need a little help to change the Galaxy forever.</class><br/><class='red'>-We're in. You will have your revolution. Let's pull this through!.</class><br/><br/>The alliance between the Heroes and the Rebels is settled and the Revolution is coming. <br/>"
