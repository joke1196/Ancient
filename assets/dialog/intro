 "<br />Dear Krystal,<br /> Peace, Quiet and Order. Those are the three things guaranteed by Our beloved Galactical Government and its first figure : Granda Frato. In them, we believe and we put our trust. Thanks to them, our life is happiness and serenity. Thanks to them, our children are safe, educated,  raised with joy and love. Thanks to them.<br /><br\/><br /> I was chosen, can you believe that? I was chosen by the Great Scientific Committee to be part of one of the most important research of all time, in the White Laboratory Spaceship. Unfortunately, the whole thing is classified, so I cannot tell you any details about it. However, you have to know that if we succeed, it will be the end of those infamous Rebels and other heretics.<br /><br /><br /> I cannot see you, neither the kids, for a long time I'm afraid and you have to know, my love, that these thoughts desperate me. Nevertheless, it give me strength to accomplish my duty towards Granda Frato. Then, when it will be done, He, as Merciful and as Great He is, will reward us in the best way you can imagine.<br /><br\/><br /> Kiss the children for me, and tell them they can be proud of their father. I swear I will go back to Corneria to see you as soon as possible. Darling, I love you. As much as we love Granda Frato.<br /><br />  Peace, Quiet and Order. Your husband, KÃ»rago.<br />",
